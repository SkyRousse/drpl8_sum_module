# A route maps a URL path to a controller. For form controllers like this
# the content is determined by the buildForm method defined by the
# form controller implementation.

# Access to these paths is restricted to users with the permission
# 'access content'. This is notated as _permission: 'access content'.

# Menu items corresponding to these URLs are defined separately in the
# add_numbers.links.menu.yml file.
