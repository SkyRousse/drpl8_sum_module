### Add Numbers | Custom Module for Drupal 8

#### By Sky Rousse

The _AddNumbers_ module adds the numbers from two input fields as submitted through a form implemented using Drupalâ€™s Form API. The sum of the 2 numbers is returned in a standard Drupal message at the top of the page. This module also utilizes form validation to ensure proper data submission as well as the AJAX API to dynamically display the sum of the inputs.

A link to the page containing the form is found as a normal menu item in the main menu.
